    "text": "Socially aware robots should be able, among others, to support fluent human-robot collaboration in tasks that require interdependent actions in order to be solved. Towards enhancing mutual performance, collaborative robots should be equipped with adaptation and learning capabilities. However, co-learning can be a time consuming procedure. For this reason, transferring knowledge from an expert could potentially boost the overall team performance. In the present study, transfer learning was integrated in a deep Reinforcement Learning (dRL) agent. In a real-time and real-world set-up, two groups of participants had to collaborate with a cobot under two different conditions of dRL agents; one that was transferring knowledge and one that did not. A probabilistic policy reuse method was used for the transfer learning (TL). The results showed that there was a significant difference between the performance of the two groups; TL halved the time needed for the training of new participants to the task. Moreover, TL also affected the subjective performance of the teams and enhanced the perceived fluency. Finally, in many cases the objective performance metrics did not correlate with the subjective ones providing interesting insights about the design of transparent and explainable cobot behaviour.\n",

    "text": "It is unclear if existing interpretations of deep neural network models respond effectively to the needs of users. This paper summarizes the common forms of explanations (such as feature attribution, decision rules, or probes) used in over 200 recent papers about natural language processing (NLP), and compares them against user questions collected in the XAI Question Bank. We found that although users are interested in explanations for the road not taken \u2014 namely, why the model chose one result and not a well-defined, seemly similar legitimate counterpart \u2014 most model interpretations cannot answer these questions. \n",

Results showed a similar question-asking performance between children who had the two \u201dclosed\u201d agents, but a significantly better one for participants with the \u201dopen\u201d agent.\nOur first results suggest the validity of using GPT-3 to facilitate the implementation of curiosity-stimulating learning technologies.
